= Syckle

A sick little syck loader.

== Description

YAML is great and complete, but load relatively slowly in large part because
it loads everything at once.  In cases where you need to quickly load a
simple YAML configuration file, the overhead is too much.

Syckle is a very simple syck binding that can load basic ruby types:
true, false, nil, numbers, strings, symbols, arrays, and hashes.  When
Syckle.load encounters a more complex object, it autoloads YAML and
defers to YAML.load.  The result is a quicker-loading, seamless
alternative to using YAML.

Benchmarks indicate a require + load using Syckle is about 10x faster than
the same using YAML, entirely due to the require time.

== Usage

Simply require syckle instead of yaml.  YAML will be set for autoloading
as necessary, and can be required at a later time if necessary (although
note that using syckle only provides a load-time benefit up until YAML
is loaded, duh).

  start = Time.now
  
  require 'syckle'
  Syckle.load("key: value")   # => {'key' => 'value'}
  
  puts "#{Time.now-start} s"

=== Bugs/Known Issues

- Syckle seems to work on both Ruby 1.8.* and Ruby 1.9.1.  It does not work
  on JRuby (I don't think JRuby uses syck).  One word of caution, for reasons
  unknown, an autoloading test under 1.9 was found to hang when written one
  way and not when written in what looks to be an identical way.  See the
  {syckle_allows_subsequent_autoloads_test.rb}[]

== Installation

Syckle is available as a gem on GitHub[http://rubyforge.org/projects/tap].  Use:

  % gem install bahuvrihi-syckle
